# Installing the Academic(ES-R) Logger for Android<Badge type="danger" text="Academic" />

The data acquired with the JINS MEME ES_R can be saved on an Android device.<br>

## Downloading the Software

Please download from [here](https://github.com/jins-meme/ES_R-DataLogger/releases).

## Installation

We will use the screen of an Android 12 device as an example.

1. Open the downloaded apk file (if installation of apps from an unknown source is not allowed, please allow it).
2. Tap `Install` when the dialog box appears.
3. Tap `Open` after installation is complete.
4. Tap `Only when using apps` when the location grant dialog is displayed (older Android's only show allow/not allow).
5. Tap `Allow` when the dialog for authorization of file access in the device is displayed.
6. Startup is complete.
