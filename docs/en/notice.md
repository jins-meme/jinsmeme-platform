* When setting down the JINS MEME, keep the convex side of the lens facing up.  
The lens may be scratched if it is placed facing down.

* Do not apply heat to the Pack or place it in any location that is subject to high temperatures.  
Otherwise, the frame may deform or crack.

* Remove the JINS MEME and turn the power OFF before going to sleep.  
Sleeping while wearing the JINS MEME can cause deformation, damage, or malfunction.

* The JINS MEME is designed for adults and is not suitable for children to wear.  
If the JINS MEME does not fit properly, the three-point electrooculography sensor, three-axis acceleration sensor, and three-axis gyro sensor may not accurately detect or obtain data.

* Do not replace the battery of the JINS MEME. The battery is built-in, and cannot be replaced.  
If the battery cannot be charged, contact the JINS MEME Customer Support Center.

* Do not take the JINS MEME into bathrooms, saunas, swimming pools or any other area where it may come in direct contact with water.  
Otherwise it can cause a short circuit or malfunction.

* JDo not use an abrasive liquid, alcohol, thinner, benzene, or polish remover to clean the JINS MEME. Also, do not wash it with water.  
Otherwise, it can cause discoloration, deformation, damage, or malfunction.

* Do not insert anything into the micro USB terminal other than what is specified in this document.  
Otherwise, the internal components may be damaged.

* JINSDo not store the Pack with any hard object such as metal as it may scratch the JINS MEME and visibility may be impaired.

* The JINS MEME contains a built-in lithium ion battery. Do not attempt to dispose of it yourself. Return it to JINS.  
Contact the JINS MEME dealer or JINS MEME Customer Support Center for return details.

* Dispose of accessories for the JINS MEME, such as the AC adapter, in accordance with local regulations.

## Notes on handling the 3-point electrooculography sensor parts (nose pad and inter-eyebrows part)

* Do not press or bend the three-point electrooculography sensor.  
Otherwise it can cause damage or malfunction

* Make sure you have the nose pad adjusted by your JINS MEME dealer.  
If you try to adjust it yourself, it may be damaged or the measurement may be incorrect.

* After use, gently wipe the sensor part with a soft cloth such as an eyeglass cleaning cloth.  
If not handled carefully, it may cause a malfunction or failure.

* If the three-point eye potential sensor part is dirty with sweat, sebum, or cosmetics, gently wipe it.  
Leaving it dirty may impair the measurement.


## Notes on radio waves

Bluetooth uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band. In addition to industrial, scientific, and medical equipment such as microwave ovens, this frequency band is also used by other radio stations of the same type, on-board radio stations for mobile identification requiring licenses such as those used in factory production lines, specified low power radio stations that do not require licenses, and amateur radio stations (hereinafter referred to as "other radio stations").

* Make sure there are no "other radio stations" in the vicinity before communicating with the JINS MEME.  
If there is radio wave interference between the JINS MEME and "other radio stations", immediately change the location of the JINS MEME, disconnect the Bluetooth, or turn OFF the power of the JINS MEME. If this does not solve the problem, contact the JINS MEME Customer Support Center.

* Keep away from other electrical appliances (such as microwave ovens or digital cordless phones) when communicating.  
When communicating in the vicinity of such equipment, normal communication may not be possible or radio interference may occur.  
If communication is affected, move away from such equipment.

* When a broadcast station or radio equipment is nearby and normal communication is not possible, change the location of the JINS MEME.  
Normal communication may not be possible when the surrounding radio waves are too strong.

* If there is a device equipped with wireless LAN in the vicinity of the JINS MEME, radio interference may occur and communication speed may be reduced or connection may be impossible.  
Keep away from any device equipped with wireless LAN when communicating.

## Safety Precautions
